# Ewon Flexy Cumulocity Connector

Copyright Â© 2022 HMS Industrial Networks Inc.

The Ewon Flexy Cumulocity Connector package provides a connector-based solution to Cumulocity for
linking Ewon devices using a direct data path with a Flexy Java application.

## Installation

Installation of the Ewon Flexy Cumulocity Connector is simple, and requires only the upload of a
handful of files to your Ewon device.

Using an FTP client of your choice, such as [Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org/), upload the
following files to the /usr directory of the Ewon device:

1. `flexy-cumulocity-connector-{VERSION}-full.jar`
2. `jvmrun`
3. `CumulocityConnectorConfig.json`

Note: The `CumulocityConnectorConfig.json` file is optional. If you do not provide this file, the
connector will use the default Cumulocity configuration and create a new file.

## Configuration

After the files have been uploaded, a device registration entry must be created in Cumulocity, and
the connector configuration file updated.

### Cumulocity Registration

To create a device registration entry in Cumulocity, you will need to open the Cumulocity UI and
navigate to the 'Registration' tab under 'Devices'.

Click the 'Register Device' button to begin the registration process.

Select the 'General device registration' option.

*Note: You may select the bulk device registration option if you wish to register multiple devices
at once. These instructions describe only the general device registration process.*

Enter the device ID of the Ewon Flexy you are registering. The Cumulocity device ID for an Ewon
device is based on the serial number of the Ewon Flexy, and is formatted as `HMS-Flexy-{SERIAL}`.

After entering the device ID, you may optionally specify a group to add the newly registered device
to, or register another device.

When finished, click the 'Next' button to finalize device registration, then click the 'Complete'
button when finished.

After the device registration has been completed, you may start up the Ewon Flexy Cumulocity
Connector with the corresponding bootstrap credentials and the device will register itself. Once
registered, it will be pending acceptance in the Cumulocity device registration portal.

### Connector Configuration File

Once the device registration has been created in Cumulocity, the bootstrap credentials must be
configured in the connector configuration file prior to starting the connector.

Using an FTP client of your choice, download and edit the `CumulocityConnectorConfig.json` file
located in the `/usr` directory of the Ewon device.

Populate the `BootstrapUsername`, `BootstrapPassword`, and `BootstrapTenant` fields with the
corresponding values for your Cumulocity tenant.

Once populated, save and upload the updated file to the Ewon device and restart the connector. In
many scenarios, it may be simplest to restart the connector by restarting the entire Ewon device.

The device will now automatically register itself with Cumulocity. After it has started up, the
device will be pending acceptance in Cumulocity. After it is accepted, the device will be properly
connected and usable.
