#### Installing a Suitable Maven Version

Many IDEs and build tools include Maven, and may be used to build the {ScDocusaurusConfig.title}
without installing Maven directly.

If you do not have a suitable Maven version installed on your system, or would prefer to use Maven
manually, follow the vendor instructions to download and install one from
the [Apache Maven webpage](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).
