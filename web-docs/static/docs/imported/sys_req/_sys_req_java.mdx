<>The {ScDocusaurusConfig.title} has been designed to work with the latest versions of Java, and has
been tested successfully with Java 16+. Older versions of Java may be compatible, but have not been
tested and are not supported.</><br/><br/>

:::note

During the Maven [package lifecycle](#package-lifecycle), an Ewon-compatible JDK will be
automatically downloaded and used to compile the resulting source code. This allows for better
cross-platform developer support, compilation consistency, and enables the use of modern Java and
Maven environments on the host by isolating source code compilation.
