The Ewon Flexy Cumulocity Connector application supports a handful of commands from Cumulocity that
allow you to control the Ewon Flexy.

The following commands are supported:

1. `set`
    1. Using the `set` command, you can set the value of a tag.
    2. Tags for child devices may also be set using the `set` command. Simply append the child
       device name followed by a forward-slash (`/`) to the tag name. For

    2. Tags for child devices may also be set using the `setf` command. Simply append the child
       device name followed by a forward-slash (`/`) to the fragment name. For
       example, `setf childName/fragmentName seriesName value`.
