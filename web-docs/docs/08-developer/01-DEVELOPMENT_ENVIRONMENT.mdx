## IDEs

This project uses the Maven build system to automatically download libraries and dependencies, and
to ensure consistent build behavior. As such, this project can be imported into any IDE that
supports the Maven build system.

### Supported IDEs

|                            IDE                             | General Config Location(s) | Launch Config Location(s)  | Code Style Config Location(s) |                                                                                                                                                                                  Notes                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Workaround: Update the remote debug configuration  to use the 'debugNoSuspend' profile. The Ewon will  begin its debug session immediately, therefore,  breakpoints at the beginning of the application  execution may be missed prior to the IDE debug session connecting. |

If desired, a remote JVM debugging session will need to be created as described in the [Deploy Lifecycle (debug)] ( #deploy-lifecycle-debug) section.                                                                   |

:::note

Additional IDEs with support for the Maven build system may be supported by this project, but
have not been tested.

### IDE-Specific Configuration

#### IntelliJ IDEA

When using IntelliJ IDEA with this project, it is recommended to use the following (free) plugins to
improve the development experience:

1. [Checkstyle-IDEA](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/1065-checkstyle-idea)
2. [Google Java Format](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8527-google-java-format)
3. [Save Actions](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7642-save-actions)

:::note

Configuration files for these plugins are already included with this project, and will be
automatically detected by IntelliJ IDEA.

:::

## Command-Line

Maven includes extensive support for the command-line interface (CLI). For more information about
Maven command-line
interface support, please refer
to [https://maven.apache.org/run.html](https://maven.apache.org/run.html).

## Getting Project Name and Version via Maven

This project includes additional metadata in the JAR file manifest, including the project's name and
version
from `pom.xml`.

To alleviate the requirement for including a hardcoded project name or version in source code, you
can access those properties as described:

```java
class MavenMetadataExample {

  String projectName = ExampleClass.class.getPackage().getImplementationTitle();
  String projectVersion = ExampleClass.class.getPackage().getImplementationVersion();
}
```

:::note

The required metadata is only included when the project is packaged via Maven. If you package
the project using the `build.xml` Ant build file, the described method of accessing the project name
and version may not work or could cause an exception.

:::

## Testing with JUnit

This project includes basic support for unit testing via the JUnit 3.8.1 test framework. An example
test class has been included in this project at `src/test/java/ExampleTest.java`. For detailed
information about JUnit 3.8.1 and its capabilities, please refer
to [http://junit.sourceforge.net/junit3.8.1/](http://junit.sourceforge.net/junit3.8.1/).

For details about the unit testing in this project, refer to
the [test lifecycle](03-MAVEN_LIFECYCLES.mdx#test-lifecycle) section on
the [Maven Lifecycles](03-MAVEN_LIFECYCLES.mdx) page.

## Requirements

### Required Java Version

<SysReqJava />

### Required Maven Version

<SysReqMaven />

### Required Ewon Firmware Version

<SysReqEwonFw />

## Contributing

Detailed information about contributing to this project can be found in
the [Contribution Guidelines](04-CONTRIBUTION_GUIDELINES.mdx).

## Support Notice

While this project is intended to replace the functionality provided by the Ewon JTK's `build.xml`
Ant build file, the Ewon-supplied `build.xml` Ant build file remains the only officially supported
environment for Ewon Java development. For more
information about the official Ewon-supplied `build.xml` Ant build file, please refer
to [https://developer.ewon.biz/content/java-0](https://developer.ewon.biz/content/java-0).

:::note

This project does not interact with the `build.xml` Ant build file, or the Ant build system.
Therefore, it is possible to use the official Ewon-supplied `build.xml` Ant build file in
conjunction with the supplied `pom.xml` Maven build file.
