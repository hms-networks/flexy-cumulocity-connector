### Clean Lifecycle

During the `clean` lifecycle, previous build output and artifacts will be cleaned up, and the entire
build output directory deleted. This lifecycle is not automatically invoked and must be manually
run.

:::info Clean Lifecycle

The `clean` lifecycle can be run with the `CLEAN (Remove Build Output)` launch configuration in
your IDE, or with the following command:

```shell
mvn clean -f pom.xml
```

:::

### Test Lifecycle

During the `test` lifecycle, any JUnit test classes in the `src/test/java` class will be run by
Maven. This lifecycle is automatically invoked by
the [package](#package-lifecycle), [install](#install-lifecycle), and [deploy](#deploy-lifecycle)
lifecycles.

In the event of a test failure, the lifecycle will fail. Detailed failure or successful test
information can be found in the `target/surefire-reports` folder.

More information about the Maven Surefure Plugin, which is used for the JUnit testing, can be found
at [https://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-surefire-plugin/](https://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-surefire-plugin/).

:::info Test Lifecycle

The `test` lifecycle can be run with the `TEST (Run JUnit)` launch configuration in your IDE, or
with the following command:

```
mvn test -f pom.xml`
```

:::

### Package Lifecycle

During the 'package' lifecycle, the application source code and resources will be compiled and
packaged in to a JAR file with the name '{artifactId}-{version}-full.jar'. This lifecycle is
automatically invoked by the [install](#install-lifecycle)
and [deploy](#deploy-lifecycle) lifecycles.

:::info Package Lifecycle

The Maven package lifecycle can be run with the `PACKAGE (Create JAR)` launch configuration in your
IDE, or with the
following command:

```
mvn package -f pom.xml`
```

:::

### Install Lifecycle

During the `install` lifecycle, the packaged application will be uploaded to the Ewon device using
the 'ewon.address,' 'ewon.username,' and 'ewon.password' properties. This lifecycle is automatically
invoked by the [deploy](#deploy-lifecycle) lifecycle, and automatically
invokes [package lifecycle](#package-lifecycle).

:::info Install Lifecycle

The Maven install lifecycle can be run with the `INSTALL (Upload to Device)` launch configuration in
your IDE, or with the following command:

```
mvn install -f pom.xml
```

:::

### Deploy Lifecycle

During the `deploy` lifecycle, the packaged and uploaded application will be run on the Ewon Flexy
device. This lifecycle automatically invokes the [install](#install-lifecycle)
and [package](#package-lifecycle) lifecycles.

The `deploy` lifecycle uses multiple Maven profiles, and can be invoked in different ways.

:::info Deploy Lifecycle (No Debugging)

The Maven deploy lifecycle can be run without debugging enabled using
the `DEPLOY (Run on Device, No Debug)` launch
configuration in your IDE, or with the following command:

```
mvn deploy -f pom.xml -P noDebug
```

:::

:::info Deploy Lifecycle (With Debugging)

The Maven deploy lifecycle can be run with debugging enabled using
the `DEPLOY (Run on Device, Debug)` launch configuration in your IDE.

The Maven deploy lifecycle with debugging enabled can also be run by command line, but a remote JVM
debugging connection must be manually created using the values from the 'ewon.address' and '
project.build.debug.port' properties. The following command will run the deploy lifecycle with
debugging enabled:

```
mvn deploy -f pom.xml -P debug
```
