## Libraries and Dependencies

<>This {ScDocusaurusConfig.title} itself does not require any libraries or dependencies. For your
convenience though, the Ewon ETK is already included as a dependency.</><br/>

### Adding Libraries and Dependencies

As required, you can include additional libraries or dependencies using the Maven build system. To
include a new library or dependency, add a new `<dependency></dependency>` block in
the `<dependencies></dependencies>` section of your `pom.xml`. For example,

```xml

<dependencies>
  ...
  <dependency>
    <groupId>commons-lang</groupId>
    <artifactId>commons-lang</artifactId>
    <version>2.6</version>
  </dependency>
  ...
</dependencies>
```

:::info

Additional libraries or dependencies must support Java 1.4, as this is the version of Java supported
by the Ewon JTK.

:::

:::caution

Adding dependencies may introduce warnings or errors during the Maven build process which are unable
to be addressed in this project. These warnings and errors can typically be ignored.

If you encounter Javadoc generation errors, please refer to
the [Javadoc Errors During Build After Updating the POM File](../06-help/02-TROUBLESHOOTING.mdx#3-javadoc-errors-during-build-after-updating-the-pom-file)
section of the [Troubleshooting](../06-help/02-TROUBLESHOOTING.mdx) page.

### Ewon ETK

If you removed the Ewon ETK dependency, or otherwise need to re-add it, you can include it by adding
the `<dependency></dependency>` block in the `<dependencies></dependencies>` section of
your `pom.xml` as follows:

```xml

<dependencies>
  ...
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.hms_networks.americas.sc.mvnlibs</groupId>
    <artifactId>ewon-etk</artifactId>
    <version>1.4.4</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
  </dependency>
  ...
</dependencies>
```

:::note

The scope must be set to 'provided' for the Ewon ETK. This indicates that the library is
provided by the system and does not need to be included in the packaged JAR file.

:::

### Solution Center Repository

The Ewon ETK and HMS Americas Solution Center libraries are available via the solution center
repository. For your convenience though, the solution center repository is already included.

If you removed the solution center repository, or otherwise need to re-add it, you can include it by
adding the following `<repository></repository>` block in the `<repositories></repositories>`
section of your `pom.xml` as follows:

```xml

<repositories>
  ...
  <!-- HMS Networks, MU Americas Solution Center Maven Repo -->
  <repository>
    <id>sc-java-maven-repo</id>
    <name>HMS Networks, MU Americas Solution Center Maven Repo</name>
    <url>https://github.com/hms-networks/sc-java-maven-repo/raw/main/</url>
  </repository>
  ...
</repositories>
