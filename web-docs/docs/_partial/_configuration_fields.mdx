import LoggingPartial from '@site/docs/_partial/_logging.mdx';

#### General
This section contains configuration fields which are used to configure the connector.

##### LogLevel (Log Level)
Parameter to configure the logging level used in the Ewon Flexy's realtime logs.
<LoggingPartial/>

##### QueueEnableDiagnosticTags (Queue Enable Diagnostic Tags)
Parameter to enable and monitor a set of diagnostic tags for the historical data queue.
These tags are automatically created and are used to monitor the health of the historical data queue
by displaying a heartbeat with the number of times the queue has been accessed, a trigger to reset
the
queue time tracker, and the number of seconds which the queue is running behind by.

##### QueueEnableStringHistory (Queue Enable String History)
Parameter to configure if string history data should be retrieved from the queue.
String history requires an additional EBD call in the underlying queue library, and will take extra
processing time, especially in installations with large string tag counts.

##### UTF8StringSupport (UTF-8 String Support)
Parameter to enable support for tag names with UTF-8 encoded characters.

##### QueueDataPollSizeMins (Queue Data Poll Size in Minutes)
Parameter to configure the data poll size (in minutes) of each data queue poll.
Changing this will modify the amount of data checked during each poll interval.

##### QueueDataPollIntervalMillis (Queue Data Poll Interval in Milliseconds)
Parameter to configure the maximum speed that the historical data be polled for new data points to
send.

##### QueueDataAggregationPeriodSecs (Queue Data Aggregation Period in Seconds)
Parameter to configure the aggregation period (in seconds) for data points processed from the
historical data queue.

:::note
A value of "-1" indicates that data aggregation is disabled.
:::

#### QueueDataAggregationMethod (Queue Data Aggregation Method)

Parameter to configure the data aggregation method for the historical data queue. This parameter is
used to determine how multiple data points in a single aggregation period are aggregated into a
single data point. The following aggregation methods are supported:

- 0: Last Recorded Value (Newest)
- 1: First Recorded Value (Oldest)
- 2: Minimum Recorded Value (Lowest)
- 3: Maximum Recorded Value (Highest)
- 4: Average Recorded Value (Average)

_Note: The aggregation method is only used when queue data aggregation is enabled, as described
above in the `QueueDataAggregationPeriodSecs` parameter description._

##### QueueDataPollMaxBehindTimeMins (Queue Data Poll Maximum Behind Time in Minutes)`
Parameter to configure the data poll maximum behind time (in minutes).
Changing this will modify the maximum number of minutes which the historical queue data polling may
be running behind by.

:::note
A value of -1 disables this functionality.

#### Cumulocity

This section contains configuration fields which are used to configure the connection to Cumulocity.

##### Host (Host)

Parameter to specify the host name of the Cumulocity server. This must be configured prior to
running the connector.

##### Port (Port)

Optional string parameter to specify the port of the Cumulocity server. Default: "8883"

##### Custom Certificate URL (CustomCertificateUrl)

Optional string parameter to specify the custom certificate URL for the Cumulocity server's
certificate.
Default: "https://certs.godaddy.com/repository/gdroot-g2.crt"

:::tip
This parameter is useful when connecting to Cumulocity Edge servers which use a self-signed
certificate.
:::

##### Custom Certificate URL Enabled (CustomCertificateUrlEnabled)

Optional boolean parameter to enable the custom certificate URL for the Cumulocity server's
certificate.
Default: false

:::tip
This parameter is useful when connecting to Cumulocity Edge servers which use a self-signed
certificate.

##### Bootstrap Username (BootstrapUsername)

Parameter to specify the bootstrap username to use when registering to Cumulocity. This must be
configured prior to running the connector.

##### Bootstrap Password (BootstrapPassword)

Parameter to specify the bootstrap password to use when registering to Cumulocity. This must be
configured prior to running the connector.

##### Bootstrap Tenant (BootstrapTenant)

Parameter to specify the bootstrap tenant to use when registering to Cumulocity. This must be
configured prior to running the connector.

##### Subscribe to Errors (SubscribeToErrors)

Parameter to enable subscribing to errors from the Cumulocity server.

##### Device Username (DeviceUsername)

This configuration field is filled automatically by the connector application, and is the device
username used to authenticate with Cumulocity.

##### Device Password (DevicePassword)

This configuration field is filled automatically by the connector application, and is the device
password used to authenticate with Cumulocity.

##### Device Tenant (DeviceTenant)

This configuration field is filled automatically by the connector application, and is the device
tenant used to authenticate with Cumulocity.

##### Data Processing Mode (DataProcessingMode)

Parameter to configure the data processing mode.
This determines how data is processed by Cumulocity.
The following data processing modes are supported:

- s: Persistent (Default)
- t: Transient
- q: Quiescent
- c: CEP

More information about these data processing modes can be found in
the [Cumulocity documentation](https://cumulocity.com/guides/concepts/realtime/#implementation).

:::note
This field is optional, and if not specified, the default value of `s` will be used.
:::

##### Parent Device Aggregated Payload Type (ParentDeviceAggregatedPayloadType)

Parameter to configure the parent (main/non-child) device aggregated payload type.
This determines the value for the `type` field in aggregated payloads for the parent device.

:::note
This field is optional, and if not specified, the default value of `None` will be used.
